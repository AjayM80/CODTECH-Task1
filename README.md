**PROJECT: MOBILE APP WIREFRAMING**

This mobile app is designed to provide a simple and efficient user registration and onboarding experience. With clean UI and intuitive navigation, this app guides new users through the sign-up process, profile setup, and verification steps, ensuring a seamless onboarding flow.

## Overview

The app's primary focus is on creating a structured and user-friendly onboarding experience. Users are guided step-by-step through signing up, verifying their identity, and customizing their profile, which is essential for apps requiring user accounts, such as social networks, e-commerce, or service platforms.

## Features

     - **Name**
     - **Phone Number**
     - **Email**
     - **Gender**
     - **Date of Birth**
     - **Country**
     - **Address**
   - Users can submit their details to create an account.

### 2. **Logo Screen**

   - Option to **Resend** the code if it wasnâ€™t received.

### 4. **Profile Picture Upload**
   - A screen allowing users to upload or choose a profile picture.
   - This step could be optional or required based on the app's design and purpose.

### 5. **Onboarding Screen with Text**

### 6. **Success Screen**
   - Confirmation screen shown upon successful registration, reassuring users that their account has been created.

## Design and Aesthetic
